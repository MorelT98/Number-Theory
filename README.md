# Number-Theory
This repository contains algorithms and functions useful in number theory, such as prime numbers, Euclidean division and modulo.
It contains 4 files:
 Division:
  - Euclidian division of a by b
  - Testing wether a is divisible by b
 gcd_lcm:
  - gcd (greatest common divisor) of a and b
  - lcm (lowest common multiple) of a and b
  - Checking if a and b are relatively prime
  - Solving the diophantine equation ax + by = c
  - Finding the Bezout coefficients (m, n) such that am + bn = gcd(a, b)
 PrimeNumbers:
  - Checking wether a given number is prime or not
  - Finding the prime factorizarion of a given number
  - Listing the prime numbers between a and b
  - Listing the prime numbers of the form ax + b (where a and b are given), 
     between m and n
 Modulo:
  - Checking wether a = b[n]
  - Solving the equation ax = b[n]
  - Finding the order of x modulo n: the smallest positive integer m such that
     x^m = 1[n]
  - Computing Euler's phi function with a given argument n: Euler's phi function is the
     number of positive integers smaller than n and relatively prime with n
  - Computing a^m modulo n
